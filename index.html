          </h1>

            <p>Trizbort is a simple tool used to create maps for interactive fiction.  First developed by <a href="http://trizbort.genstein.net">genstein</a> back in 2010, he continued to update until March, 2013 when he open-sourced the code.
                Fast forward to 2015 when I picked up the development and along with Andrew Schultz (focused on documentation and testing) we continue to improve this great software.
                Follow our blog for announcements and updates (<a target="_blank" href="https://lautzofif.wordpress.com/tag/trizbort/">https://lautzofif.wordpress.com/tag/trizbort/</a>).

            </h2>

            <ul>
              <li>Add filename to the invalid trizbort file on open of file. There is a bug coming where this message is showing after restart on update of Trizbort and this will help debug this.</li>
              <li>Improved the statusbar to make it more extensible in the future.</li>
              <li>Simplified how the zoom widget in the statusbar functions.</li>
              <li>Added caps and num lock indicators to statusbar.</li>
              <li>Added the option to have text break or not break on dashes. (#456)</li>

              <li>Attempting to open an invalid trizbort file was still marking it as the last loaded project, which could cause it to try and load it again when trizbort reopened. (#442)</li>
              <li>If the last loaded project was from the web, doing a file open (Ctrl-O) would throw up an invalid path error when opening the file open dialog. (#443)</li>
              <li>Fix error when zooming in or out too far. (#447)</li>
              <li>Start/end room properties will not be copied when copying a room, this fixes the issue where we could have more than one start room. (#460)</li>
              <li>shift - right-clck allows panning of the map. The context menu no longer shows when releasing the mouse (#455)</li>
              <li>fixed issue when saving a file many times in succession can temporarily corrupt the recent map menu list. (#454)</li>
              <li>fixed issues with the handling of "Hand Drawn Edges" and improved the handling of the UI in regards to this setting.</li>
              <li>middle text alignment should now be handled more consistantly. (#473)</li>
              <li>Handle tooltips better when they are displayed and panning the page or moving the room. (#459)</li>

              <li>Objects in room, added 'w' to indicate something is worn by an object, added 'h' to indicate that an object is a part of it's parent.</li>
              <li>refactored some of the exporting code.</li>
              <li>saving new map for the first time was throwing an error. (#427)</li>

            <p>We made a lot of improvements to exporting to your favorite IF language and cleaning up our own code. We are also trying to add features that make sense to simplify building of maps while still giving you plenty of shortcuts and power tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are also in the process of improving the export to different languages. We've added ALAN support and improved support for I7, I6, TADS and ZIL. As always if you find ways to improve, have suggestions or find bugs, please let us know or submit an issue
                on github. Documentation is a little outdated so apologies on that. Hopefully we'll be updating that soon.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ENH: - beginning of object definition language in the objects list. Still in beta (so use at own risk as things may change, but feedback is appreciated) and really focused on I7 at the moment. We will continue to improve, fix and tweak.</li>
                <li>ENH: #23 - Command line option to start automapping of file. -m transcriptfile [trizbort map name]</li>
                <li>ENH: #27 - Saves app window dimensions on close.</li>

                <li>ENH: #81 - Annotations can be now be saved to PDFs (the annotation will be the room description)</li>
                <li>ENH: #170 - The short cut key '0' will select the starting room.</li>
                <li>ENH: #184 - Ctrl-B backs up your current project file.</li>
                <li>ENH: #185 - TADS/Adv3Lite export now supports regions.</li>
                <li>ENH: #188 - \ (backslash) on room will attempt to reorganize the connections. Be careful with this as it tries to be smart about room location in relevence to each other. It can make mistakes so we are looking at ways to improve and make trizbort a bit smarter.</li>
                <li>ENH: #189 - '[' and ']' as well as Ctrl-[ and Ctrl-] will move the selected connector around to available ports on the connected rooms.</li>
                <li>ENH: #197 - Automap improvements: Mark start room.</li>

                <li>FIX: #172 - Disallow room names to be just numbers as it creates bad I7 code.</li>
                <li>FIX: #173 - Like #172, Blank room names are not allowed as it will create bad exported code.</li>
                <li>FIX: #180 - When running a test command in the I7 IDE, command numbers in brackets are created at the front of each prompt line, like '>[7] n', this confused the automapper.</li>
                <li>FIX: #234 - Trying to improve the export to code with some special characters from non-english languages. (Further improvement suggestions welcome)</li>
                <li>FIX: #246 - Fixed some areas that were causing Trizbort to think the map was "dirty" and needed saved when it really wasn't.</li>
